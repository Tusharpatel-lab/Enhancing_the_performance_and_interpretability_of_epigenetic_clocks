## Description
TFMethyl is a DNA methylation–based age prediction model.  
Input DNA methylation beta values (CpGs × samples) are:

1. Subset to the CpGs used during model training (Illumina 450K array)
2. Reordered to match the trained CpG set
3. Aggregated into predefined CpG clusters using the median
4. Transposed to sample-wise format and passed to the trained model

The model predicts **log-transformed age**, which is then back-transformed to
chronological age (years).

## Input
- DNA methylation beta values  
- Matrix or data.frame with **CpGs as rows and samples as columns**
- CpG IDs must match Illumina 450K annotation

## Required
- R version 4.4.0 (or above); data.table 1.17.6; glmnet 4.1-9

## Usage
In R:
```r
source("TFMethyl.R")
